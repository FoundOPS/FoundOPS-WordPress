	<li>Since we started developing FoundOPS, our goal for our platform has been to make the same quality and customization of a traditional enterprise solutions available to any business. We have identified the barriers that previously prevented small businesses from employing an enterprise system.

<ul><li><ul><li>leading security and backup features. This means that our clients will never be required to make any investments in servers. Furthermore, our Microsoft Silverlight application can be accessed through any major Internet browser on any PC or Mac. In all likely hood, this means your existing computers are more than sufficient for your needs. Finally, if you use our mobile application, we have chosen Google’s Android operating system which currently offers the largest selection of (and least expensive) mobile phones and wireless providers.</li>
	<li class="big">Customized Solutions</li>
	<li>Larger businesses have the luxury of investing hundreds of thousands of dollars into custom enterprise solutions. Mid-size businesses can afford to have IT professionals customize existing systems or mesh together a number of applications. Until now, small businesses were forced to accept software as is. FoundOPS developed its application around the idea that anyone should be able to customize the system.</li>
	<li class="big">Training</li>
	<li>By focusing on simple and intuitive interfaces, we think we’ve dramatically cut down the learning curve on enterprise software. While traditional solutions offer weekend seminars and classes in their systems, we’re confident that anyone who has learned how to access their email can learn how to operate our system. This removes down time and training costs, which allows you to focus on running your business.</li>
	<li class="big">Price</li>
	<li>Finally, we think we’ve come up with highly competitive pricing for our offering. When you add on the savings you’ll see from hardware, personnel, IT support, and training/down time, FoundOPS can be saving your business tens of thousands of dollars a year.</li>
