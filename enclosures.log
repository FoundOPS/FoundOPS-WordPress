Post contents:Software companies tout the term ”enterprise grade” as an excuse for their application’s convoluted maze-like interfaces and grey forms designed circa 1990. Supposedly, it offer some unmatched level of stability, security, and scalability. In reality “consumer grade” technologies (such as Gmail) are easier to use, have enjoyed higher reliability, and are hassle free. FoundOPS is committed to “consumer grade” design and in this article I will discuss why your company should be too.

<strong>How did enterprise and consumer design practice diverge?</strong>
Enterprise giants software is merely a product of its upbringing. In the past, enterprise software design was steered by large corporate executives who enjoyed the luxury of never using the software they were spec’ing. While consumer marketed companies hired product managers and user experience and interface designers, enterprise companies pushed out features so ugly, only a developer’s mother could love them.

<strong>The new wave of consumer grade design in the enterprise.</strong>
Back in July of 2010, Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box.net, a company that produces business content management software for the enterprise, announced in a blog post that “Enterprise Software is Sexy Again”. Levie cited the new wave of enterprise software companies, including his own, PBWorks, Asana, and Workday, which have created software unlike anything the enterprise has seen before. These companies have all experienced great successes, inspiring fear in their multibillion dollar competition. A quick look at the websites, offices, and products of these companies and you’ll see a far greater resemblance to YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook then traditional enterprise companies. With a deeper examination of their product design, you’ll draw the same conclusion I have, that these companies have employed consumer grade design.

<strong>What’s the advantage for my business?</strong>
Ok, so it looks pretty, but beyond that, well designed software offers a number of advantages to its users.
		<ul>
<li><strong>Significantly shorter training times</strong> – For those with exposure to consumer-grade software like Gmail or Yahoo, learning how to use the next generation enterprise software takes minutes or hours, not days or weeks.</li>
	<li><strong>Higher efficiency</strong> – Do more with fewer clicks.</li>
	<li><strong>Leverage generation Y</strong> – The latest generation entering the job market has grown up around the Internet. If your old system doesn’t engage and take full advantage of your new hires’ talents, how can your company?</li>
	<li><strong>Visualize your business</strong> - Modern visualization tools can give you live insights on your business.</li>
	<li><strong>Be Happier</strong> – Remember the copier scene in office space? (<a href="http://movieclips.com/Ndfb-office-space-movie-printer-beat-down/">http://movieclips.com/Ndfb-office-space-movie-printer-beat-down/</a>) If you’ve used traditional enterprise software, you can probably relate. You’re going to spend a fair bit of time on your enterprise system. Do you really want to that much time frustrated?</li></ul>

<strong>What is FoundOPS doing?</strong>
FoundOPS was developed with a design focus from day 1. 

<ul>
	<li><strong>The best interface technologies</strong> -  We use Microsoft Silverlight and HTML5 to create the most immersive user experience possible.</li>

	<li><strong>User-centric design</strong> - Participation from everyone who uses our system (managers, dispatchers, field technicians, your customers) is an integral part of our design process.</li>

	<li><strong>Design culture</strong> - We appreciate good design and place value on novel concepts like simplicity and organic interactions.</li>
</ul>



Over the next months, consumer grade design will be permeating into all types of business applications. FoundOPS is strategically positioned to lead this new wave of design and revolutionize how people interact with their business applications. If you are interested in contributing to our design process, please consider joining our beta program at this link.

Post contents:There is a transformational shift occurring in technology. Organizations are cutting back their IT departments, business managers are rapidly deploying solutions, and people are all buzzing about the cloud. In this article I will try to address the following questions: what the cloud and “software as a service” is, why businesses are racing to the cloud, and what FoundOPS’ role is in this technological shift.

<strong>What is the cloud?</strong>
The cloud is a method of delivering computing and storage through the internet. An important term for the cloud is “software as a service” (SaaS). SaaS is an extension of the cloud that allows for the delivery of software through the internet. Gmail, Facebook, and Salesforce are all examples of software delivered over the internet and SaaS.

<strong>Why are businesses racing to the cloud?</strong>
Software as a service replaces the need for on premise servers by centralizing them to one place. Businesses are racing to the cloud because SaaS brings a long list of benefits.
<ul>
	<li>There is no need to purchase servers or server equipment. </li>
	<li>Hosting and maintenance are managed by the service provider and built into one price; eliminating surprise problems and surprise consultant expenses.</li>
	<li>There is little or no start-up costs and capital investment required for cloud based systems.</li>
	<li>Cloud servers securely share resources and turn them on and off as needed. That is how cloud computing uses 95% lower power consumption than traditional on premise systems.</li>
	<li>Cloud based systems are accessible anywhere there is an Internet connection. If your computer disappears or crashes, your data will still be available and secure.</li>
</ul>

What is FoundOPS role?
We are committed to providing the latest and most effective technology. That is why all of FoundOPS services are provided through the cloud and as software as a service.

A couple of interesting facts about our service:
<ul>
	<li>Our software runs on Microsoft Azure’s infrastructure. Azure boasts 99.9% up-time and near infinite redundancy. Azure is the same platform Microsoft uses to host it’s own services (Hotmail, Windows Live, Office 365).</li>
	<li>Cost savings from the cloud allow us to charge less than half of what our competitors charge. New businesses can now take advantage of technology they previously could not afford.</li>
	<li>FoundOPS rates are all inclusive. Along with hosting, maintenance, and automatic daily backups, support and updates are also built into our pricing.</li>
	<li>FoundOPS services can be rapidly deployed and therefore are quick to value. Services can easily be scaled up or down without penalty.</li>
</ul>


It is no surprise companies are quickly moving to the cloud. FoundOPS is here to help the service industry take advantage of this amazing technology. If you are interested in being part of our beta program please sign up here.

Post contents:If your business is using an outdated operations software, or worse, still using a manual system then you are missing out on massive efficiency gains. All sized businesses are quickly realizing that without investment in technology, it is impossible to stay competitive.

<strong>Why is efficiency so essential to small and medium sized businesses?</strong>
Everyone knows that efficiency is a good thing. Yet proportionally, larger business outspend small businesses on efficiency investments. While the return on investment for small and medium sized businesses has a few less zeros tacked on, it is far more important. Small and medium businesses have less resources compared to large corporations; their ability to use them efficiently is often the determination for their success and growth. 

<strong>Why is now the right time for efficiency?</strong>
Economic turns have caused many businesses to buckle down. Improving efficiency is an important way to ensure your survival. Operations software can not only save your business money on fuel, labor, and other expenses, it can also increase your competitive advantage and help you to retain your current customers while adding new ones. Additionally, recent technology developments are making efficiency software more attainable then ever. With cloud computing and “Software as a Service”, large upfront investments have been replaced with sensible monthly subscriptions. (You can read more about cloud computing and SaaS here)Hyperlink to jons article

<strong>What can FoundOPS do for your efficiency?</strong>
FoundOPS has developed an system that can radically improve your business operations.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Advanced routing algorithms</strong> - In a single click our software will generate routes that make your fleet more efficient, reducing fuel consumption, vehicle usage, and labor costs.</li>
	<li><strong>Data entry</strong> - Even in small and medium sized businesses, data entry can be a major administrative cost. With FoundOPS, your entire team can contribute customer and service data, whenever and where ever it is collected.</li>
	<li><strong>Automatic invoicing</strong> -  By integrating with Quickbooks you can ensure that every job makes it to an invoice, dramatically increasing your collection rates.</li>
	<li><strong>Actionable business intelligence</strong> - Use insights gained from your data to make better decisions about the future of your business.</li>
</ul>


Lets face it, we all have days where we have wished there were just a few more hours. Running a business is no simple task (trust us we know). Being more efficient is a goal of every business owner. FoundOPS can make your business dramatically more efficient and if you’re interested in seeing for yourself, sign up for our beta program here.

Post contents:<strong>Cloud technology has opened up a new playing field for small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs).</strong>  Solutions to problems that used to be too expensive to implement are now more affordable and available on a mass scale.  Further, the tools necessary for adopting a cloud solution are now commonplace in the office.  The team at FoundOPS is committed to continuous research into cloud-based solutions to SMB operations problems, and this <a href="http://www.foundops.com/papers/CloudComputingForSMBs.pdf">white paper</a> explains why.

Post contents:With over 500 exhibits to see in a just few days, FoundOPS knows the competition will be fierce for the <a href="http://www.pumpershow.com/">2012 Pumper and Cleaner Environmental Expo</a> which starts today. After all, it is the "world's largest annual trade show for environmental service professionals." We know you have limited time, but let us quickly give you a few reasons to stop by our booth.

<div class="orange"><strong>As the #pumpershow website says - this conference is about,"discovering new tools to help you work better and smarter - and open whole new lines of business."</strong></div>But 'tool' is a very ambiguous term in today's world and it no longer applies to just industry vehicles and new equipment. The tool which will help you pump your competition out of business is an operations software which provides an all-in-one solution to your customer relationship management, invoicing, dispatching, and routing needs.<!--more-->

<div class="orange"><strong>Technology can help you transition to a business which focuses on lean performance and efficiency. </strong></div>

When you stop by our booth we promise to get you up to speed on an application which can positively affect your customers, your employees, and your bottom line. While you're looking at new trucks, come test drive our software and maximize your company's performance. Meet with a product manager and a member of the product development team - they'll introduce you to cloud computing software. 

Need even more temptation to stop by? We also have a pretty rockin' giveaway - an Android tablet. At the conference you'll probably load up on stress balls and letter openers, but this is a prize you can actually use for your business!

If you STILL think you'll be too busy to demo our product during exhibit hours, just stop by our booth for a few minutes. <div class="orange"><strong>We'll be more than willing to set up a meeting at another time when you're free during the week or we could also schedule a web demo for the weeks following the conference.</strong></div>

For more information about FoundOPS and our product - check out our features page on the website. And don't forget - if you need help deciding where to eat or what to do while you're in Indy this week, check out our last post: <a href="http://wp.foundops.com/2012/02/22/the-foundops-field-guide-to-indianapolis/">The FoundOPS Field Guide to Indianapolis</a>.

<p>Because my parents are both small business owners, I've grown up recognizing the amount of day to day work which goes into truly managing every aspect of the company.

<p><div class="red"><strong>The commonly used idiom of, “wearing multiple hats” truly comes into play when discussing the roles of a small business owner.</strong></div><!--more--> And after reading about the Saas (Software as a Service) trend, I’m sure you are thinking, “I’m already so busy – I can’t imagine learning about a new type of software service to add to my existing responsibilities.”</p><p> (For an easy way to catch up on today’s technology terms, click <a href="http://www.techterms.com">here</a>)</p>
<div class="red"><p style="width:649px;"><strong>The fact is, though, that new technology isn’t just a trend- it’s a revolutionary way to manage your business and to keep up with competitors in your industry.</strong></p></div>
<div class="red"><strong>Software Services and Platforms will:</strong></div>

<li style="width:614px;"><strong>Lower costs</strong> by reducing paperwork and time spent on tasks such as dispatching drivers, invoicing, etc.</li>
<li style="width:614px;"><strong>Increase Productivity</strong> for managers and employees alike by allowing access to data anywhere, anytime - thereby allowing more room for collaboration within the team.</li>
<li><strong>Add Value</strong> to your business by maximizing efficiency of the time and resources you are already committing to your business.</li>
<li><strong>Improve Customer Service</strong> because your lean and exact processes will positively affect their business as well. This will lead to more referrals and more business.</li>
