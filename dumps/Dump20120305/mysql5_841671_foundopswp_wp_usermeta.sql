During high school Jonathan got his start working as software consultant for the service industry. In college, he knew the potential that existed for a small business software platform and began working on a solution. The prototypes he developed have become the precursor to FoundOPS.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what he likes to do in his free time, Jonathan responds “Free time?” Despite his borderline obsessive commitment to FoundOPS, Jonathan still manages to sneak out of the office for the occasional bike ride or run. He’ll also read anything he can get his hands if he thinks it will give him a bit of knowledge.

At Purdue, Oren studied an eclectic mix of Political Science, Art and Design, Entrepreneurship, Viticulture, and Jewish Studies. Eventually he was approached by Jonathan with an interesting application of both form and function. “From what I’ve seen, business enterprise software suffers from an impressive lack of both. These issues are the result of years of decision-makers at large corporations with the luxury of not having to use the software they were purchasing.”\r\n\r\nNow Oren believes user interface has emerged as one of the most significant considerations for the future. “Technology has progressed to such an advanced stage that the bottleneck has become the connection between technology and the users. Computers now wait for us more than we wait for them.” By emphasizing simple and clean design practice, Oren hopes to create an interface that users will find intuitive and even addicting to use. “One day FoundOPS will be done when it does everything our users want and nothing else.”\r\n\r\nBeyond software, Oren loves spending time with his family and friends out on Shelter Island. An avid sailor, he claims his first crib was the v-berth (the triangle shaped bed located in the very front of a boat) on his father’s Cape Dory sailboat.
